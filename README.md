# Space Alexa Skill

This skill doesn't work in production! Sadly, the Amazon Echo is very restrictive on the [MP3s it allows to play](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/speech-synthesis-markup-language-ssml-reference#audio).

An Alexa skill for the Amazon Echo – it plays space audio from the [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#sounds). Generated by [generator-alexa-skill](https://github.com/cameronhunter/generator-alexa-skill).

## Example phrases
```
Alexa, ask Space what does space sound like?
Alexa, ask Space will anyone hear me scream in space?
Alexa, ask Space play a sound from space
```

See `model/UTTERANCES` for more example phrases.

## Development

### Setup
You must add a file `config/nasa.config.js` which exports an object containing your API keys for the NASA and SoundCloud APIs.

```javascript
export default {
  api_key: '',
  soundcloud_id: ''
}
```

### Test

```bash
npm test
```

### Package

```bash
npm run package
```

This creates `build/package.zip` containing the compiled skill - this can be uploaded directly to AWS Lambda. It exposes a single function `index.hander`. Skill utterances defined in the `model` directory are expanded and output to `build/UTTERANCES`.

### Deploy

```bash
npm run deploy
```

If you configure the project with AWS credentials then you can build, test, package and deploy the project with a single command. You can check it out in the [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-east-1#/functions/space).
